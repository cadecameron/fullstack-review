# fullstack-review
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

## High Level Goals of this Sprint
- Write and integrate a React/JSX client with an Express/MongoDB server
- Define and create RESTful API routes to interact with the server
- Interact with the GitHub.com public API endpoints
- Learn how to make scoping decisions around MVP functionality, given significant timing constraints
